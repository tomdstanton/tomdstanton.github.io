Yeah fine I concede. 

I'm finally joining the ranks of all the other scientists who think people care enough about their opinions to actually read online.

I also need a place to put my CV and cool 35mm photos and Strava stats and music and videos I like.

Also I told my therapist I'm "journalling" so I guess this counts, right?

Those who know me know how bad I am at keeping up to date with stuff, so if this falls off, I'm calling it here first.

Hopefully this is the start of something beautiful. It would be fitting if the title of this post (and blog in general) was something witty, clever or poiniant but, alas I am fighting through a post-lunch Karaage-induced coma (à la
 [Kai Dining](https://www.instagram.com/kaidiningmelbourne/?hl=en)).

Anyway, first legit post and other bits will be up soon.

Innabit.
